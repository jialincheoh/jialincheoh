### Hi, I'm Jia ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer scientist excited about learning and traveling. I stepped foot in over 10 countries so far. I got my BSc in Computer Science from Purdue University in the USA. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning and Network Science. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a special fascination about satellite maps. When I am not coding, I play around with location coordinates, satellite maps, etc. on places that fascinates me the most. 

I can be reached via [email](jcheoh@purdue.edu). I'm always open to conversations and collaborations.
