### 👋 Hi, I’m Jia

I’m a **computer scientist and researcher** fascinated by **large language models** and **human–AI interaction**.  
Currently, I’m a **Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Purdue University**, where my research explores how large-scale models learn, reason, and align with human understanding.

- 🌱 **Current focus:** studying how humans interpret and evaluate language model behavior.  
- 🧠 **Research interests:** large language models, alignment, interpretability, reasoning, and NLP systems.  
- 🌍 **Outside the lab:** I’ve traveled to over 10 countries and love learning how people and cultures shape communication.  
- 🏊 **Fun fact:** I’m an avid open-water swimmer with an infinite love for the ocean.  
- 😄 **Pronouns:** she/her  

📬 **Reach me at:** [jcheoh@purdue.edu](mailto:jcheoh@purdue.edu)  
I’m always open to conversations, collaborations, or just geeking out about AI and language.
